					<h2>Static vs Transactional</h2>
					<p>
						Does your website exist to just provide <em>information</em>?
					</p>
					<p>
						Or are you trying to get visitors to <b>actually do something</b>?
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Static could also be considered "informational".
						Does your website exist to provide
						information, or is the website supposed to make some actually interact with it?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Navigation</h2>
					<p>
						People need to navigate your site and you need to <b>make it easy</b>.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						Problem: What does "easy" actually mean?
					</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Small number of links?</li>
						<li>Lots of links with sub-navigation?</li>
						<li>Clear language?</li>
						<li>Use of imagery and icons?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Does "easy" mean there's only a few options presented?
						That there's a lot of filtering presented?
						Are you writing the names of links in a way people understand?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="dist/images/best-buy-nav.png" alt="Best Buy navigation" class="stretch">

					<aside class="notes">
						If we look at Best Buy's navigation, would you say this is "easy"?

						Well, it depends on what TYPE of store you have.  If you have a store
						with very large inventory, this may be the appropriate type of navigation.
						It needs to be "easy" to navigate all the product types and drill down to
						the make and model of the item you're loking for.

						Note: There's more than one navigation on a page.  I count three main navs.

					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="dist/images/best-buy-nav-highlight.png" alt="Best Buy navigation highlighted" class="stretch">

					<aside class="notes">
						Green: Navigation focused on customer accounts and those who placed orders already
						Orange: A navigation for what we can assume Best Buy has determined what are the top
						actions for visitors coming to the site.
						Pink: The navigation for products and services

						Important: You don't need to dump all your navigation under one hamburger menu.
						Break it up based on action.

						Best Buy is bit of an extreme example though.

					<img src="dist/images/snow-devil-nav.png" alt="Snow Devil Navigation" class="stretch">

					<aside class="notes">
						Simpler navigation. You don't have to stick it at the top - everyone
						does that, that's boring.

						Different weights of links communicate a bit of hierarchy.
						The stuff they want you to do is in all caps.
						Less frequented links are in lower case.
						And then you have account and cart icons for navigation.

						to people how to navigate your site if you are just going to rely
