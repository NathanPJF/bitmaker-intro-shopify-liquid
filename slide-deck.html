						Shopify has its roots in selling products online, but since then it's

						If you're going to be working on storefronts, you'll need some sort of testing environment.
						But you also want to make it easy to go from working on a theme to launching a theme.

						Create a partners account so you can work at your own pace.  Don't try to go the "free" route,
						you'll be locked out after 2 weeks beacuse that's intended for merchants, not developers.

					<img src="dist/images/best-buy-nav.png" alt="Best Buy navigation" class="stretch">

					<aside class="notes">
						If we look at Best Buy's navigation, would you say this is "easy"?

						Well, it depends on what TYPE of store you have.  If you have a store
						with very large inventory, this may be the appropriate type of navigation.
						It needs to be "easy" to navigate all the product types and drill down to
						the make and model of the item you're loking for.

						Note: There's more than one navigation on a page.  I count three main navs.

						Green: Navigation focused on customer accounts and those who placed orders already
						Orange: A navigation for what we can assume Best Buy has determined what are the top
						actions for visitors coming to the site.
						Pink: The navigation for products and services

						Important: You don't need to dump all your navigation under one hamburger menu.
						Break it up based on action.

						Best Buy is bit of an extreme example though.

						does that, that's boring.

						Different weights of links communicate a bit of hierarchy.
